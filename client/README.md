# Profile-Finder

## v0.1.0

### New Profile Finder build without NextJS and without TailwindCSS. This build will be much more without being stuck with unnessacery tools or frameworks you would possibly want to get rid of because of the limitations that they bring. This is going to be a feature rich application which shouldn't be held back when I eventually and probably want to get rid of TailwindCSS. Already dat would be a nightmare, translating all TailwindCSS into plain CSS, it's better to start over now it is not too late yet, and start building without unnessacery tools, rely more on being motivated to have more work and harder more complex work, but full customizability and no need to rewrite whenn the application is much further developed and it is too late en the problem had become very big.

### The desired production build of this project will stay secret a long time, but I will keep this repository public as long as possible and maybe work with a private repository besides this one, I hope that there are people who can help me and review my development and tell me every bit they know about how to do things better.
